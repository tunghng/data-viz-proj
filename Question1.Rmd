### AAPL Daily Returns

```{r}
# Calculating daily returns
aapl_data <- aapl_data %>%
  arrange(date) %>%
  mutate(daily_return = (adj_close / lag(adj_close) - 1) * 100)

# Plotting daily returns
ggplot(aapl_data, aes(x = date, y = daily_return)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Daily Returns of AAPL Stock",
       x = "Date", y = "Daily Return (%)")
```


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(plotly)

# Assuming 'aapl_data' already has 'daily_return' calculated and is ordered by date

# Calculate mean and standard deviation
mean_return <- mean(aapl_data$daily_return, na.rm = TRUE)
std_dev <- sd(aapl_data$daily_return, na.rm = TRUE)

# Create a ggplot histogram
p <- ggplot(aapl_data, aes(x = daily_return)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, fill = "darkblue", color = "darkblue") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_return, color = "red", linetype = "dashed", linewidth = 0.2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_return + std_dev, color = "red", linetype = "solid", linewidth = 0.2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_return - std_dev, color = "red", linetype = "solid", linewidth = 0.2) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Daily Returns of AAPL Stock",
       x = "Daily Return (%)", y = "Frequency") +

The Daily Returns graph provides a clear depiction of AAPL's volatility, characterized by fluctuations around a central tendency with occasional spikes. This volatility is a testament to the dynamic nature of the stock market and Apple's sensitivity to market sentiments and news.

- **Statistical Highlights**:
  - **Positive vs. Negative Days**: With 1,721 days (52.61%) recording positive returns and 1,544 days (47.20%) showing negative returns, the data highlights a slightly higher tendency towards positive movements, albeit with substantial variability.
  - **Volatility Measurement**: The standard deviation of daily returns stands at approximately 1.81%, emphasizing the stock's short-term volatility. The range of daily returns, from a maximum of 11.98% to a minimum of -12.86%, further underlines the potential for significant price swings within a single trading day.
  
### Trend Distribution of AAPL Daily Returns

```{r}
# Defining trend categories based on daily returns
aapl_data$trend <- with(aapl_data, case_when(
  daily_return <= 0.5 & daily_return >= -0.5 ~ "Slight or No change",
  daily_return > 0.5 & daily_return <= 1 ~ "Slight Positive",
  daily_return < -0.5 & daily_return >= -1 ~ "Slight Negative",
  daily_return > 1 & daily_return <= 5 ~ "Positive",
  daily_return < -1 & daily_return >= -5 ~ "Negative",
  daily_return > 5 ~ "Extremely Positive",
  daily_return < -5 ~ "Extremely Negative"
))

# Plotting trend distribution
aapl_data %>%
  group_by(trend) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(trend, -count), y = count, fill = trend)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Trend Distribution of AAPL Daily Returns",
       x = "Trend", y = "Count") +
  coord_flip()

```

The trend distribution offers a nuanced view of AAPL's daily return patterns, categorizing days into various trends based on the magnitude of price changes. This segmentation reveals the predominance of days with 'Slight or No change', highlighting an underlying stability amidst volatility.

- **Statistical Insights**:
  - **Trend Distribution**: Approximately 30.03% of the days witnessed 'Slight or No change', indicating stability on a significant portion of trading days. The presence of 'Positive' (26.33%) and 'Negative' (20.31%) days illustrates the stock's capacity for notable price movements, providing opportunities for strategic trading.

## Conclusion
  
AAPL's historical price trends, daily returns, and trading volumes illustrate a stock characterized by robust long-term growth and notable short-term volatility. The upward trend in adjusted close prices signals strong investor confidence and growth potential, making AAPL an attractive option for long-term investors. However, the significant day-to-day price fluctuations underscore the stock's volatility, presenting both opportunities and risks.

**Key Takeaways for Investors**:
- **Long-term Growth**: AAPL shows promising growth prospects, supported by its historical price increases.
- **Short-term Volatility**: Investors must navigate short-term volatility, evident in daily returns and volume spikes, which reflect the stock's sensitivity to market sentiments and news.
- **Informed Decision-Making**: A strategic approach, leveraging insights from trading volumes and price trends, can help in capitalizing on opportunities and managing risks.

In essence, while AAPL offers substantial growth potential, it also demands careful consideration of its volatility. Investors looking to benefit from AAPL's market position should prepare for the inherent risks, adopting strategies that balance the pursuit of growth with risk management.
